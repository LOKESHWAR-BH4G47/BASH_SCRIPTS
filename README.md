## Website Update Script (websiteupdate.sh)

This script checks if the content of a website has changed compared to a stored version in the `hospital.txt` file. If the content has changed, it sends an email alert with the changes.

Usage:
```bash
./websiteupdate.sh

File Organizer Script (fileorganizer.sh)
This script organizes files in a specified directory by moving them into subdirectories based on their file extensions. It categorizes files into "files," "images," or "videos" folders.

Usage:

bash

./fileorganizer.sh
How to Use:
Run the script by executing the respective commands in your terminal.

For websiteupdate.sh, make sure to set the URL variable to the website URL you want to monitor, and configure the email address in the script for the alert.

For fileorganizer.sh, provide the directory_to_organize path when prompted. The script will organize files in that directory.

The script outputs messages to inform you about the progress and completion of the tasks.

Note:
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts.

These scripts are provided as-is and may require additional configuration depending on your specific use case.

Feel free to modify and customize these scripts to suit your needs.
